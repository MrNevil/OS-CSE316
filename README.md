Your project shell must support i/o-redirection on both stdin and stdout. i.e. the  command line: programname arg1 arg2 &lt; inputfile > outputfile will execute the program programname with arguments arg1 and arg2, the stdin FILE stream  replaced by inputfile and the stdout FILE stream replaced by outputfileWith output redirection, if the redirection character is > then the outputfile is created if it does  not exist and truncated if it does. If the redirection token is >> then outputfile is created if it  does not exist and appended to if it does. Note: you can assume that the redirection symbols, &lt; , > &amp; >> will be delimited from other  command line arguments by white space - one or more spaces and/or tabs. This condition and  the meanings for the redirection symbols outlined above and in the project differ from that for  the standard shell. I/O redirection is accomplished in the child process immediately after the fork and before  the exec command. At this point, the child has inherited all the file handles of its parent and  still has access to a copy of the parent memory. Thus, it will know if redirection is to be  performed, and, if it does change the stdin and/or stdout file streams, this will only effect the  child not the parent.
